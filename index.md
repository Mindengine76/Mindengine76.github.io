## Who am I?
I am a newbie programmer studying Computer Science for game development at Falmouth university. Unlike most other 
students I had no background in programming prior to beginning the course 8 months ago. 

I am very interested in 'gamification' and the application of computer science in education and e-health. I am also 
very intrigued by the social and psychological effects computer science and games have on individuals and societies. 

Personally I don't play computer games, but I do enjoy building them. I am also interested in electronics and robotic,
but am also very new to this field.
